Type guards are essential in TypeScript because they allow you to restrict a variable's type inside a certain scope. Because TypeScript's type system is static, it cannot determine a value's true type in dynamic situations unless it is specifically specified. By informing TypeScript that a variable belongs to a certain type, type guards improve type safety and guarantee that actions on the variable are appropriate for the variable's true type.

Runtime issues might result from TypeScript's inability to distinguish between types in the absence of type guards. You may increase the code's stability, predictability, and security by utilising type guards.

For example, when working with string | number, TypeScript would not automatically know if a variable is a string or a number without a type guard. By using type guards, like typeof value === 'string' or value instanceof SomeClass, you inform TypeScript of the exact type within a block, allowing the compiler to safely infer the types and prevent invalid operations.
